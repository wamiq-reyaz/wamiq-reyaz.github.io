abstract = {Realistic, scalable, and controllable generation of furniture layouts is essential for many applications in virtual reality, augmented reality, game development and synthetic data generation. The most successful current methods tackle this problem as a sequence generation problem which imposes a specific ordering on the elements of the layout, making it hard to exert fine-grained control over the attributes of a generated scene. Existing methods provide control through object-level conditioning, or scene completion, where generation can be conditioned on an arbitrary subset of furniture objects. However, attribute-level conditioning, where generation can be conditioned on an arbitrary subset of object attributes, is not supported. We propose COFS, a method to generate furniture layouts that enables fine-grained control through attribute-level conditioning. For example, COFS allows specifying only the scale and type of objects that should be placed in the scene and the generator chooses their positions and orientations; or the position that should be occupied by objects can be specified and the generator chooses their type, scale, orientation, etc. Our results show both qualitatively and quantitatively that we significantly outperform existing methods on attribute-level conditioning.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
