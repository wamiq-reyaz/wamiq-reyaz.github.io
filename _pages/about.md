I am a graduated PhD student at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/). I worked with [Prof. Peter Wonka](https://peterwonka.net/) in the [Visual Computing Center (VCC)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc) at KAUST.

For my PhD, I worked on using NLP models to generate various kinds of non-languages. I am currently working on using diffusion models for generating 3D representations. 

I interned at Huawei, London with [Jiangkang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/) and [Pradyumna Reddy](https://preddy5.github.io/), and at UCL/Adobe, London with [Prof. Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/N.Mitra/) and [Paul Guerrero](https://paulguerrero.net/).
